# CurrencyConverter
4real

Used Node.js as backend, Angular,Bootstrap for UI.

Once the code is pulled, run the following commands on CLI

####npm install 
####node server.js

Open http://localhost:8080

####node-cron will fetch the data from http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist-90d.xml every day after 6:00PM Europe/Bucharest time. (it should be usually after COB) to update the currency MAP/values.

Used Rickshaw for generating interactive Graph on client side.

Any currency can be selected and can be compared with other currencies.

An implementaion of this code is available here.
